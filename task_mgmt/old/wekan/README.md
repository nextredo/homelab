### Note
- Internal server error on signup is fine
- Still works, just cos email isn't setup

## Review
- UI
  - Is a bit dated
  - Few bugs here and there, don't hamper functionality much though
    - Workarounds exist
  - Highly emoji-based in terms of iconography
  - Task creation is a bit complex looking I think
  - Basically unusable in mobile orientation / format
- Seems fine otherwise I guess
- Has subtasks and checklists - not sure of the distinction
- Has
  - Checklists (& subtasks?)
  - Swimlanes
  - Labels
  - Card sorting
  - List shrink/expand
