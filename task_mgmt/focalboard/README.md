## Review
- Looks *very* similar to notion, even down to the colour palette
- Ever so slightly glitchy UI
- Unmaintained though ((scary))
- I like that tasks have emojis as their icons
  - Well it's cool but it's more shit to add tbh
  - Random emoji picker is definitely a good shout
- Due date period is an interesting concept
- Sum at the top of each column is a cool idea
- Task calendar view is bonza
