# Task Management
## Concepts / Words
### Components
- Boards, lists, cards
- Swimlanes

## Options (under review)
- Largely from [awesome-selfhosted](aw-sh-t-mgmt)

### Commercial options
- Not picking any of these
- Just good references
- Trello, Notion, Jira, Asana
- TickTick

### Ruled out FOSS options
- TaskBoard
  - Too basic, unmaintained
- Taiga
  - Don't need a full project management tool
- AppFlowy
  - Lot of stars, written in dart + Rust
  - Not as open source as I'd like (open core)
- OpenProject
  - Don't need a full project management tool
- Plane.so

- TaskCafe
  - Unmaintained but looks good
  - Still in Alpha
- Nimbo
  - Small, unmaintained
- Taskosaur
  - *Very* AI driven, seems to push pricing
- Nextcloud Deck
  - Nextcloud is a pain to setup ngl
- WeKan
  - UI isn't great
- Trilium

  - Could be good for docs though

### Tempting FOSS options
