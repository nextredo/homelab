# Organisation
**THE SYSTEM EXISTS TO MANAGE TASKS**
**DO NOT GET CAUGHT UP MANAGING THE SYSTEM**
**IT SHOULD BE A TOOL, NOT A TASK**
- Use the app how it's designed, makes it a lot easier
- Reduce (ideally to 0) duplication

## Projects
- Top of the hierarchy
- Mutually exclusive - tasks in one at a time
- Not sure about this
- For work, it'd be different products
- But I only have 1 life, so that's 1 product/1 lifecycle
- Different people use user/account fields instead, not this

## Boards
- Top of the hierarchy
- Mutually exclusive - tasks in one at a time
- **Based on categories/classifications that might require different lists within them**
  - e.g. habits requires
    - Backlog, habituating, habituated, discarded, completed
  - Regular tasks
    - Backlog/inbox/dump
    - To do (ready), doing (in progress), done (finished)
    - Ready, archived
    - Failed, expired/overdue
  - Shit to buy
    - To buy, not needed, en route/in progress, bought, used, get rid of (return/sell)
  - Groceries
    - To buy, not needed, en route/in progress, bought, used, get rid of (return/sell)
  - To consume?
    - Watchlist, to listen/podcast/music list, reading/book list
  - Stuff management
    - Take home, get from home
    - Sell, dispose, use
- A board per year?
- Board per area of interest?
- [This site](https://www.wrike.com/blog/complete-guide-personal-kanban/)
  - Suggests boards are related to an area of your life
  - e.g. home vs work

## Lists (✅ concept locked in)
- **The state of the task**
- Mutually exclusive - tasks in one at a time
- Unambiguous, we know what goes here
- States
  - To do/ready
  - Doing/in progress (limit this column)
  - Done/finished
  - Blocked, archived, failed, expired
  - Terminated, forwarded
  - Graveyarded? (that's just terminated ig)

## Tags/labels (〰️ concept mostly locked in)
- Multiple, boolean - taks can have either have/not have any combo of these at once
- Not sure if you can have tags *and* labels
- Qualitites than can overlap on a given task
  - e.g.
  - The task "Complete the fan control knob project for Dad"
    - Get measurements from it
    - 3D model it
    - Print it
    - Check it's correct
    - Give it to Dad
  - This is in the categories of "Social" and "Engineering"
    - Requires me to do something in relation to someone else
    - Requires Engineering skills and/or helps improve them
  - Or reading something from the work reading list might be work + personal dev
  - Input (to consume, like a book, movie, podcast)
    - Reading, watching, learning
  - Output (to produce, like write some code or fix something)
    - Physical, digital
  - Systematic
    - Habits, hobbies
  - Or meal prepping for someone is social + food
  - Or sw dev on an open src project is social + personal dev + engineering
  - Good for showing which tasks are twofers
- Areas of study/interest
  - Engineering, Language (German), Fitness, Personal Dev
  - Finance, Work-esque, Chores, SES/Volunteering, Food
  - Labour
  - Admin/Life Admin, Event/Someday??, CRM (Social)??
- Would sub areas help?
  - e.g. Engineering --> Software --> Self-Hosting
  - Fitness --> Cycling
- Or maybe attributes?
  - Long-term, short-term?
  - These are probably irrelevant, recurring/non-recurring tasks can handle that

## Swimlanes (✅ concept locked in)
- **Fancy display filters based on attributes**
- Not sure what these would help with to be honest
- Seems to be used for people
- Could be a nice looking way to filter by tags I guess
- Due dates maybe? Priorities?

## Tasks/cards (✅ concept locked in)
- **The unit of doingness**
- The things to be done themselves
- Should ideally be a few hours to a few days each?
- e.g. setup a self-hosted kanban app

## Subtasks (✅ concept locked in)
- **Subunits of doingness**
- Things within a task that need to be done
- e.g. read chapter 1, 2, 3, ... in task "read 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas"

## Attributes
- Priorities
- Due date
  - If applicable
  - Avoid this where you can
  - Gives more meaning to *real* due dates

# Questions
- How to handle task recurrance?
  - Using "recurring tasks" feature?
  - In different boards or something?
