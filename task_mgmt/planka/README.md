## Review
- Suuuuper clean UI
  - I like that the card is super empty by default
  - And you add stuff as you need
- Can/has
  - So much stuff you can do in individual tasks smhhhh
  - Dedicated task archive
- I reeeeeally like this
- Need to get a copy of the repo, clone it and setup a good docker for it
- Seems as feature complete as I could possibly need to be honest
- Only thing that susses me out about this one is the licensing
- Recent card highlighting is cool
